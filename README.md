# AI-Driven Phishing Detection System

This project develops an **AI-driven phishing detection system** that uses **machine learning models** to identify phishing emails and suspicious URLs.  
By analyzing email content, headers, and URLs, the system classifies emails as **legitimate** or **phishing**.  
It leverages multiple datasets for phishing detection, URL validation using **Bloom filters**, and domain legitimacy checking.

---

##  Features

- **Email Phishing Detection**  
  Uses BERT-based machine learning models to classify emails as phishing or legitimate.

- **URL Validation**  
  Integrates Bloom filters for fast and efficient URL validation, checking if URLs belong to known malicious websites.

- **Domain Legitimacy Check**  
  Cross-references domain names against a dataset of legitimate domains to ensure the authenticity of email URLs.

- **Suspicious Activity Monitoring**  
  Scans email details and flags suspicious activity based on predefined rules and data patterns.

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- CNN (for URL veerification)
- BERT (for email phishing detection)
- Pandas, Scikit-learn (for data processing and model training)
