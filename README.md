# AI-Driven Phishing Detection System

This project develops an **AI-driven phishing detection system** that uses **machine learning models** to identify phishing emails and suspicious URLs.  
By analyzing email content, headers, and URLs, the system classifies emails as **legitimate** or **phishing**.  
It leverages multiple datasets for phishing detection, URL validation, and domain legitimacy checking.

A **flagship innovation** of this system is the development of a **Chrome extension** that provides **real-time phishing detection** while browsing.  
Once installed, the extension actively monitors any hyperlink the user hovers over.  
If the link appears suspicious, the model instantly alerts the user â€” offering **immediate, on-the-fly protection** against phishing attacks during web surfing.

## Features

- **Email Phishing Detection**  
  Uses BERT-based machine learning models to classify emails as phishing or legitimate.

- **URL Validation**  
  Integrates Bloom filters for fast and efficient URL validation, checking if URLs belong to known malicious websites.

- **Domain Legitimacy Check**  
  Cross-references domain names against a dataset of legitimate domains to ensure the authenticity of email URLs.

- **Suspicious Activity Monitoring**  
  Scans email details and flags suspicious activity based on predefined rules and data patterns.
