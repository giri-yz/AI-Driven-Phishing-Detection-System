# AI-Driven Phishing Detection System

This project aims to develop an AI-driven phishing detection system that uses machine learning models to identify phishing emails and suspicious URLs. By analyzing email content, headers, and URLs, the system classifies emails as legitimate or phishing. The project leverages several datasets for email phishing detection, URL verification using Bloom filters, and domain legitimacy checking.

## Features:
- **Email Phishing Detection**: Uses machine learning models (BERT-based) to classify emails as phishing or legitimate.
- **URL Validation**: Integrates Bloom filters for fast URL validation, checking if the URLs belong to known malicious websites.
- **Domain Legitimacy Check**: Cross-references domain names with a dataset of legitimate domains to ensure the authenticity of email URLs.
- **Suspicious Activity Monitoring**: Scans email details and flags suspicious activity based on predefined rules and data patterns.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- BERT (for phishing detection)
- PyBloom (for URL validation)
- Pandas, Scikit-learn (for data processing and model training)

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/giri-yz/Suspicious_email_checker
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Suspicious_email_checker
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the phishing detection or URL validation script with your own dataset, use the following commands:

1. **Phishing Detection**:
   Run the script to classify phishing emails:
   ```bash
   python phishing_detection.py
   ```

2. **URL Validation**:
   Use the URL validation script to check the legitimacy of URLs:
   ```bash
   python url_validation.py
   ```

Make sure to replace the dataset paths in the scripts with your own data files.
